## Installation

Clone the github repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashikagah/spiral-lcs
```
## Dependencies

1. Function `rm_spirals.m`, a MATLAB implementation of the Rogers-McCulloch model in two dimensions (2-D) from [Rogers-McCulloch repo](https://github.com/ashikagah/Rogers-McCulloch).

2. Java Information Dynamics Toolkit [JIDT](https://github.com/jlizier/jidt).

## Usage

1. Generate time series of spiral waves and information flow

In MATLAB command window, 

```
>> generate_data
```
It uses the function `rm_spirals.m` to create sequential stimulations according to the stimulation file `s4_stim.mat` to induce four spiral waves in a 2-D lattice. It saves the time series of the excitation variable (_ts_) in a file `orig60.mat` and its binarized time series in a file `bi60.mat`. It also creates and saves the time series of information flow [uo, vo] in a file `uvo60.mat`. The whole process will take several hours, depending on the system used.

2. Eulerian analysis

In MATLAB command window, 

```
>> eulerian_analysis
```
It shows Shannon entropy, instantaneous information flow and total information flow over time, all in an Eulerian perspective.  

3. Lagrangian analysis

In MATLAB command window, 

```
>> lagrangian_analysis
```
It shows 

## Spatial domain

- Grid size: 11.9 x 11.9 cm
